    This app collection, designed by the Materials Theory Group - Ohio University (MTG-OU), constructs 
    initial models for molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of different carbon structures including
    amorphous graphite, multi-shell fullerenes, multi-walled carbon nanotubes, and porous carbon.

    **ðŸ‘ˆ Select a constructor from the sidebar** to build your initial models for MD simulations!

    ### Previously deployed MTG-OU apps
    - This [streamlit app](https://porous-carbon-constructor.streamlit.app/) (also included here ðŸ‘ˆ) constructs atomistic porous carbon models which 
      can be converted to continuum models for finite element simulation. See the associated publications in [[1]](http://people.ohio.edu/drabold/pubs/253.pdf) and [[2](http://people.ohio.edu/drabold/pubs/261.pdf)].
