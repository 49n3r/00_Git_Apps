    This app designed by the Materials Theory Group - Ohio University (MTG-OU) builds random 
    initial models for molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of amorphous graphite, multi-shell fullerenes
    and carbon nanotubes.

    **ðŸ‘ˆ Select a constructor from the sidebar** to build your initial models for MD simulations!

    - This [streamlit app](https://porous-carbon-constructor.streamlit.app/) (also included here ðŸ‘ˆ) constructs atomistic porous carbon models which 
      can be converted to continuum models for finite element simulation. See the associated publication here.
